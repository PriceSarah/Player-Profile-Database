# Player-Profile-Database

To use, download the zip and open the program. Then click to search or exit. If you do 'search', then type in a name of a player. 
If that player doesn't exist then it'll create a new player where you can enter a score as well. 
If the player does exist then it'll ask if you want to alter the players name and score or not
